## What I Learned

I learned that communication is very important, especially between the designer, developer and copywriter. There were many times where we iterate again, because we wanted to change something. In the end, a lot of time and effort were wasted, and there were too many uncertainties in between. However, I am proud that the website is complete and usable for everyone!
