I was privileged to be able to unbox the brand new iPhone 11 Pro, which was launched on 27 September 2019 in Malaysia, right in front of your eyes! Check out the first impressions of me in the video below!

## Conclusion

Overall, I think the iPhone 11 Pro has pretty good designs and a solid overall material quality. Although some people do not really like the 3 cameras that the new iPhone 11 Pro has to offer, but I find it aesthetic and unique.
