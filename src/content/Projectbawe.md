## What I Learned

I have gained the experience of building a website for a social purpose, as well as collaborating more with the founder to ensure that the website goals meet with Project BAWE's goal. Also, I didn't imagine the possibility that coding for social purpose can be a form of contribution to Project BAWE and to the society too!
